                     First, It will be available at any time and everywhere. Secondly, this can enhance time efficiency and user convenience. At last, by adding all the users’ information 
                     of a participant area, we can create a massive database, which will be useful for analysis and prevention.
            
        
                     
            CHAPTER TWO
            Literature Survey
            1.	About Document Management System
            A document management system (DMS) is a system used to receive, track, manage and store documents and reduce paper. Most are capable of keeping a record of the various versions 
            created and modified by different users (history tracking). [1]
            
            2.	Types of Document Management System
                 There are four primary types of document management systems. There are server-based systems, such as a locally installed library cataloging system; database systems, such as
                  MySQL, that can store, sort and manage a variety of files and file types; cloud-based systems, such as Folderit, where the information is uploaded and stored remotely; and web-based systems. [2]
            
            3.	 Benefits of DMS [3]
            o	Automated workflow
            o	Reduced storage space
            o	Enhanced security
            o	Easier retrieval
            o	Better collaboration
            o	Backup and disaster recovery
            
            	Improved Workflow
                                  It’s expected that most businesses process would entail communication both internally (department to department) and externally (third parties). For instance, some people will create
                                   the documents; others will review, approve and finally dispatch the documents.
            With document management systems such as OpenKM, it is possible to utilize validation rules and perform specific actions on your documents, such as metadata capture, classification of documents, and
             electronic signature, without human involvement. This speed ups business processes as well as enhances their quality. 20-35% of operating revenue costs are caused by poor data quality.
                
            	Reduced Storage Space
                        Paper-based systems need a lot of storage space. In most cities, commercial property (larger offices or off-site storage) cost an arm and a leg. Paper, file folders, filing cabinets, and filing 
                        staff can also be very expensive in the long run. An electronic document management system can reduce such costs significantly. Besides cutting costs on space, going paperless means you will also
                         save time lost in faxing, copying, and manually searching for files.
            	Easier Retrieval
            According to a survey done by Gartner, an average organization spends about $120 in labour to find a misfiled document and another $220 in labour to reproduce a lost document. This research further reveals that
             7.5% of all organizational documents disappear into thin air while 3% of the remainder gets misfiled. Also, most employees will spend only 15% of their time-consuming information, but waste half of their valuable 
             time searching for it. As a solution, organizations need to implement a reputable DMS that can retrieve files by a word or phrase in a document or apply index categories to a document or folder. OpenKM also makes 
             remote retrieval a reality.
            	Enhanced Security
            It’s no secret that security is a foremost challenge for most organizations. No manual document management system is watertight to protect sensitive information from leaking to malicious people. However, with a
             strong DMS, you can control who can access what document. Also, most document management software leaves an audit trail to let you know who viewed and edited your document, as well as the time when the document was accessed.
            4.	 Digital Document
            
            The evolving notion of "document" among Otlet, Briet, Schuermeyer, and the other documentalists increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to
             digital technology seems to make this distinction even more important.[4]
    
            5.	Forms of Documents
            Documents vary by type, function and size. Personal document, legal documents, organizational or business documents, research or historical documents are examples of forms of documents. These types of documents are used by 
            individuals, organizations, governments and corporations in areas like collating and presenting research, data, statistics, course objectives, policies, procedures and business plans.[5]
        
            6.	About OCR
            
                    Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, 
                    a photo of a document. [6]
